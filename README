A toy TCP proxy server that will pause the flow of traffic, buffering
until you unpause.

I wrote this one morning after a chat with Andrew, at Meetup.  He
needed a proxy for testing a daemon of his that talked to a RabbitMQ
server (iirc).  I pointed him towards simpleproxy but it got me
thinking and this turned out to be a fun little project.
